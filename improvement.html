            <p class="text">The formation of a habit involves four stages: 1. Cue, 2. Craving, 3. Response, and 4. Reward.<br>
                <strong>1.Cue:</strong>In this stage, you need to think (engage in brainstorming) about what you will get if you perform a certain action. If the action results in a good reward, you can include it in your future plans.            
                <br><strong>2.Craving:</strong> People must have motivation or a desire to perform a specific action. Without motivation, it's impossible to turn an action into a habit because you'll do it without any desire, and you'll simply stop doing that action.
                <br><strong>3.Response:</strong> This stage involves taking action. It means actually performing the action and starting the process.
                <br><strong>4.Reward:</strong>Satisfaction from the action is the reward. You will realize that a particular action brings satisfaction, and you'll start doing the entire cycle again and again because you know it will make you feel better.   
                <br>Without completing all four of these stages, a habit will not form.

            <p class="text">Each person possesses the potential for self-betterment and decline, with a narrow 1% margin in either direction. This concept extends to our habits, whether constructive or harmful, as they tend to grow more entrenched over time, shaped by the methods we employ for habit control. The critical factor hinges on the strategy adopted to foster or restrain these habits. Sustained endeavors to bolster positive habits or mitigate negative ones can yield substantial transformations over time, emphasizing the significance of a purposeful and efficient system for nurturing and enhancing habits.
