            <p>We're aware that I had to modify this website to make it compatible with mobile devices. After working on it continuously for three hours a day, I completed the task. I made several adjustments, adding and removing elements, and I even had to let go of the beautiful design I initially created for desktop computers (although it still looks pretty good). Now, you can access and enjoy my daily news updates from your mobile device. </p>

            <p>I've initiated my project, opting for programming languages like HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript. My primary goal is to expedite the project's completion. I'm enthusiastic and focused on this endeavor, aiming to efficiently structure web content with HTML, enhance visuals through CSS, and potentially add dynamic functionality with JavaScript if needed. I'm dedicated to effective time and resource management for a successful and timely project outcome. </p>
