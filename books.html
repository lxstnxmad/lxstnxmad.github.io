        <h2>Grit</h2>
        <p>This book has taught me many valuable lessons. While reading it, I came to understand that:<br>
            1.One must have a strong character.<br>
            2.It's essential not to abandon a task halfway.<br>
            3.Setting clear goals is crucial.<br>
            In general, the book discusses incredibly useful principles that can greatly benefit one's <br>future. It emphasizes that to achieve your goals or dreams, you need a combination of talent<br> and a lot of hard work. You might work for just 1-2 hours a day, but that may not be enough,<br> so you must increase your daily work time. Breaking down your dreams into smaller,<br> manageable pieces is essential. It's like a staircase: to reach one main goal, you need to set<br> two goals that will help you achieve the primary one, and so on. By dividing these dreams<br> into sub-goals, you'll eventually create a comprehensive system, ensuring you always know<br> what to do. Additionally, you must possess the willpower and desire within yourself.<br>
            In summary, this book has imparted several important life lessons, illustrating that achieving<br> your dreams requires both talent and substantial effort. Breaking down your aspirations into<br> smaller steps and maintaining determination are key factors in reaching your goals.</p>
